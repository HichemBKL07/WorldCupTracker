## Team Members and Contributions
This project was a collaborative effort by three team members:

- **Murat Aydin (the GOAT)**  
  - Responsible for **access management** and the **admin interface** (CSS, HTML, and SQL requests).
  
- **Mathias Braune**  
  - Handled all the **PHP code** that communicates with the database (matches, players, etc.) and created the **HTML structure** of the website.

- **Hichem Benkahla (me)**  
  - Worked on **web scraping with the BeautifulSoup library** (using FBREF.com), the **database creation**, and the **global appearance** of the website (CSS).

The **database structure** was designed collaboratively by all team members.

## Data Source
The data was scraped from [FBREF.com](https://fbref.com/en/), an excellent resource for football statistics.
